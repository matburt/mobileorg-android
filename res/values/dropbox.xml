      These values are required by the Dropbox API and are assigned by Dropbox
      who requires that they stay a secret.  If you want your test builds to work
      then you will need to create a developer account and create a new application
      at which point the consumer key and consumer secret assigned to you will only
      work for your username unless you choose to request production status.
